Result - 
As a result, while this project is simply an implementation of Huffman coding, it is not as efficient as the current compression algorithm used to compress files.
For instance, inputFile.txt (2.2MB) is compressed to compressedFile.huf (1.1MB) and then decompressed to outputFile.txt (2.2MB).
